# BERT
BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a state-of-the-art model for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. It is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers, which is ideal for a variety of NLP applications.
